    <dt>NORTH POLE/SOUTH POLE</dt>
    <dd>This place is <strong>freaking cold</strong>.Supposedly the "final frontier" is outer space, yet we haven't even explored 95% of Earth's oceans or its poles. As detailed by antarctica.gov.au, "The mean thickness of the Antarctic ice sheet is 2.16 km; the maximum known thickness of the ice sheet is 4776 m (Terre Ad√©lie)." As a continent that holds approximately 90% of Earth's fresh water, you can gain a sense of how much smaller the North Pole is in comparison. You could find unique Arctic organisms and gain an opportunity to see the Northern Lights, but most likely you'll see ice and more ice.

The North Pole and Antarctica are similar except for a few key differences. Possibly the most significant being that land lies under Antarctica's ice and mostly water under the North Pole's. On paper, the South Pole seems like the more attractive expedition choice.

Not only will the North Pole be boring, but it will also be hazardous. The number of dangers contained at the North Pole could not be overstated. Arctic predatory animals, dehydration, and frostbite? The North Pole is not a place to raise a family. Plus, there's no wi-fi for reading thetravel.com. Already a deal breaker. These are 25 things in the North Pole we are glad to be far away from.

25/25
Frostbite is a serious issue!
Ice at the North Pole can be deceiving. What may appear to be a place to walk safely over could be a disaster waiting to happen. One can fall through thin ice and succumb to severe frostbite. The frostbite that happened to Mr. Deeds when he was younger is an exaggeration for comedic purposes, but not as far from the truth as you'd guess.

Hypothermia and other conditions could occur for those falling through thin ice. Thin ice is abundant throughout the North Pole and is almost like falling in quicksand. Will the North Pole ever be safe to visit?</dd>
